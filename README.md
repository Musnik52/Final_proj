# Project Airlock - Travel & Flights Hub

Here is my final project for the 
John Bryce Full-Stack Develepor's 
diploma requirement.
*IMPORTANT*:
Make sure to check and meet the 
requirements before initiating the project.
## üß¨Project's DNA 

- _Back-end:_
    Most of the back-end is based on python
    and its libraries (see 'requirements.txt' file).
    Node.js is used to set up the server and manage API requests.
    Communication is via microservice.

- _Front-end:_
    The components are renderd using React.js,
    with the use of custom CSS & Bootstrap libraries.

- _Databases:_
    SQL - Postgres
    NoSQL - MongoDB

- _Additional:_
    Micro-service: RabbitMQ

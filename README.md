# 🛫Project Airlock🛬 - Travel & Flights Hub

This is my final project for the 
John Bryce Full-Stack Develepor's 
diploma requirement.
*IMPORTANT*:
Make sure to check and meet the 
requirements before initiating the project.
This is a website where clients, airport companies
and administrators can log-in and perform various actions, such as purchasing a flight ticket, 
updating information, create new users, change flight info & more!
## 🧬Project's DNA 

- _Back-end:_
    Most of the back-end is based on python
    and its libraries (see 'requirements.txt' file).
    Node.js is used to set up the server and manage API requests.
    Communication is via RabbitMQ (a microservice).

- _Front-end:_
    The components are renderd using React.js,
    with the use of custom CSS & Bootstrap libraries.

- _Databases:_
    SQL - Postgres (used to store the main database). 
    NoSQL - MongoDB (used to sore a copy of the "users" table, for validations).

- _Additional:_
    Micro-service: RabbitMQ
